The paradox establishes the existence of two twins, one of whom decides to make or participate in a trip to a nearby star from a ship that will move at speeds close to those of light. In principle and according to the theory of special relativity, the passage of time will be different for both twins, passing faster for the twin that stays on Earth as the other twin moves away at speeds close to those of light. Thus, it will age earlier.
